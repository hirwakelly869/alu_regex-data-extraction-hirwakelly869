GitHub Instructions:
1. Create the repo: alu_regex-data-extraction-hirwakelly869
2. Clone your repo created to allow you code the regex expression 
3. Commit your code with meaningful messages:
4. Push to GitHub from your local or using the GitHub web UI.

How it works:
When you run the program (extractor.py), the following happens:
1. An output/ directory is automatically created (if it doesn't already exist).
2. For each data type (e.g., email, phone, URL), it reads entries from the corresponding .txt file (like emails.txt).
3. It validates each entry using the appropriate regex.
4. Valid entries are saved to a file like output/extracted_email_address.txt.
5. Invalid entries are saved to a file like output/invalid_email_address.txt.
